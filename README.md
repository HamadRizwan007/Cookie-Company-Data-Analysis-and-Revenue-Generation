# Cookie Company Data Analysis and Revenue Generation

Welcome to the Cookie Company Data Analysis and Revenue Generation project repository! This repository contains the code and documentation for cleaning, preprocessing, and analyzing data from a cookie making company. The data includes information about customers, orders, and revenue generated.

## Project Overview

In this project, we have performed the following tasks:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: We cleaned and preprocessed the raw data to ensure its quality and consistency. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.

2. **Database Linking**: We established relationships between different tables using primary and foreign keys to create a comprehensive database schema. This enabled us to effectively analyze the interconnected data.

3. **Data Analysis**: Utilizing the linked data, we conducted various analyses to gain insights into customer behavior, order patterns, and revenue generation trends.

4. **Report Generation**: We utilized Power BI to create visually appealing and informative reports. These reports present key findings and insights derived from the data analysis process.

5. **DAX Queries and Advanced Calculations**: Dive into advanced calculations and queries using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). Explore the provided DAX query files to understand how to manipulate data effectively.
